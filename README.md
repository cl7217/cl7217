## 🧠 About Me


I'm a highly motivated software developer with a proven ability to learn quickly and solve complex problems. Passionate about delivering meaningful, high-quality projects that make a real impact.

With hands-on experience in both frontend and backend development, I’ve collaborated with real clients using modern technologies and industry best practices.

Backed by a solid academic foundation in algorithms, data structures, and system-level programming, I bring both theoretical depth and practical know-how across web and desktop platforms.

Now, I’m eager to take on my first professional role where I can contribute immediately, grow rapidly, and help build scalable, production-grade software.
