## 🧠 About Me

I'm a highly motivated and fast-learning software developer with strong problem-solving skills and a love for building meaningful, high-quality projects. I’ve gained hands-on experience in both frontend and backend development, working with real clients and modern technologies.

💡 I bring a strong academic foundation in algorithms, data structures, and system-level programming, with practical experience in both web and desktop development.

🔍 I'm currently seeking my first role in the tech industry where I can contribute, grow, and make an impact.
