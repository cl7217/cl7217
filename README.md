## 🧠 About Me

I'm a highly motivated software developer with a proven ability to learn quickly and solve complex problems. Passionate about delivering meaningful, high-quality projects that make a real impact.

With hands-on experience in both frontend and backend development, I’ve collaborated with real clients using modern technologies and industry best practices.

Backed by a solid academic foundation in algorithms, data structures, and system-level programming, I bring both theoretical depth and practical know-how across web and desktop platforms.

Currently, I am actively working as part of a two-person development team on **Empleados Debt Collection**, a professional debt collection system used by real contractors and clients. My responsibilities include designing and implementing business logic, developing RESTful APIs with ASP.NET Core, managing database integration with Entity Framework Core, and building reporting features — all following a clean, modular layered architecture.

Now, I’m eager to take on my first professional role where I can contribute immediately, grow rapidly, and help build scalable, production-grade software.
